# The disruption to the WMS/WMTS service on \*geo.admin.ch has been resolved.

## 6 Mai 2025 - Announcement regarding the disruption of the WMS/WMTS service on \*geo.admin.ch from the 30th of April to the 1st of May.

On the 30th of April and 1st of May, the WMS service and WMTS service provided by geo.admin.ch were restricted or unavailable, which also affected the print function in the map viewer.

Our specialists were able to identify the cause after just over a day. A routine update of a computing cluster that we carried out in the cloud, even though all routine tests had been successful, led to unexpected problems accessing certain file systems due to the rollout of new system libraries. This primarily resulted in a large number of our WMS layers becoming unavailable. The problem was resolved by our specialists by rolling out new system components on the afternoon of 1 May.

We apologise for any inconvenience caused.

Thank you for your understanding and patience.
