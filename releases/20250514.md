  - the GetCapabilities document of wms.geo.admin.ch now includes direct links to geocat.ch metadata for each available geodata layer.

  - the layer ch.swisstopo.swissimage-product now supports transparency and is available as PNG tiles in the WMTS service.

  - the object ID values of the layer ch.vbs.schiessanzeigen will change for all objects due to geometrical changes in the source data with one of the next releases. Existing permalinks to objects may not work anymore and will have to be replaced by the new object idâ€™s (chsdi fields featureId and id). In addition there will be a new attribute bezeichnung_ort on the dataset. The other existing attributes will stay.
