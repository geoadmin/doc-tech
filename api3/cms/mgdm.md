# Data Model (MGDM) Registry: Model Repository for basic geodata under the Federal Act on Geoinformation

The concept of the INTERLIS Model Repository (syn. data model store) is to make data models usable as an http resource. This involves storing the INTERLIS model files on a web server, where they can be used directly by the FME plug-in ‹ili2fme›, for example. The advantage for the user is that the model files and any other imported data models do not have to be stored locally.

### Publishing a new «minimal geodata model» (MGDM) in the data model store

There is no direct online access to the publication of «minimal geodata models». The data model store is moderated and the entry of new data models is carried out by GCG/COGIS.

In accordance with the [Recommendations for Modelling](https://www.geo.admin.ch/de/geoinformation-schweiz/geobasisdaten/geodata-models.html), the model documentation is published or linked. In every case the INTERLIS model file (\*.ili file) is entered in the data model store.

⇒ The INTERLIS model file and the model documentation (as a PDF document or as a permalink) can be submitted for publication via the contact models@geo.admin.ch.
